Problem: - When visiting any product page Shopify throws a 404 page not found error.

Already attempted:

- Aligning the product page template to 'default product' to no avail
- Starting from scratch and creating a template ensuring names match
- Creating a "dynamic" template did work but the issue was some of the styles were off and i didn't want the default product page template to be "dynamic" it should be "default product" and nothing else.

Update this file with an approach
