This file was created to test if git pushes are working properly.

**Time created:** $(date)
**Commit hash:** This will be filled in after commit

If you can see this file on GitHub, then git push is working correctly.

## Issue being debugged:
- Local git shows commits are pushed successfully
- GitHub API shows commits exist  
- But commits don't appear in GitHub web interface
- Need to verify if pushes are actually working

## Test commits made:
1. Empty commit to trigger theme sync
2. Test sync commit with actual file change  
3. This file creation commit
