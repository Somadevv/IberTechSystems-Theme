berTechSystems ‚Äì Project Brief
Project Type:
Custom E-commerce Shopify Website

Client:
IberTechSystems

Overview:
This project involves building and refining a professional Shopify e-commerce site for IberTechSystems. The focus is on completing key sections of the website, particularly the Product Page, and ensuring the rest of the site is fully fleshed out with meaningful and relevant content. This brief.md file serves as the central point for tracking progress and maintaining 1-to-1 communication with ClaudeCode.

‚úÖ Primary Task ‚Äì Product Page Tabs & Feature Metafields
Current Setup:

A tab system has been implemented on the product page.

The default tab displays the product description.

Beneath the tabs, there's a list of dropdown sections for individual product features.

Expected Functionality:

Each dropdown feature is sourced from product metafields.

Each feature must:

Have a title (e.g., "Battery Life", "Connectivity").

Include a sub-description explaining or detailing the feature.

These features should appeal to the customer by clearly showcasing product benefits and technical highlights.

The system must be dynamic, meaning it adapts based on the metafields filled in for each individual product.

Next Steps for ClaudeCode:

Review the existing tab/dropdown implementation.

Ensure that all features pull from properly structured metafields (title + sub-description).

Improve visual layout and accessibility where needed.

Allow for easy maintenance by merchants (add documentation if necessary).

üè† Homepage Tasks
Populate all homepage sections with relatable, on-brand content.

Follow the IberTechSystems business model and industry (electronics/tech).

Identify and fix any broken or missing links in the main navigation menu.

üìã General Tasks
Perform a site-wide audit to:

Identify and complete any missing sections or content gaps.

Add new sections/pages where appropriate to enhance the user journey or support the sales funnel.

Maintain styling consistency and usability across all devices and screen sizes.

üóÇ Project Management
Create and maintain a file called brief.md in the root of the project.

This document (you're reading it now) will serve as the central communication point between me and ClaudeCode.

All tasks, notes, and project updates will be added here.

Include a section for discussion, comments, or check-ins.
