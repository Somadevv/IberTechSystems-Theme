Fix standard pages to not use custom liquid to generate page - COMPLETED
- ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Multiple pages (privacy policy, cookie policy, warranty conditions, contact us, shipping & delivery, terms & conditions) were using custom sections (policy-content, general-content) with hardcoded content instead of the main-page section that renders content from Shopify admin.
- SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Converted all problematic page templates to use the standard main-page section:
  * /templates/page.privacy.policy.json - Changed from policy-content to main-page
  * /templates/page.cookie.policy.json - Changed from policy-content to main-page  
  * /templates/page.warranty.conditions.json - Changed from general-content to main-page
  * /templates/page.terms.conditions.json - Changed from policy-content to main-page
  * /templates/page.shipping.delivery.json - Changed from general-content to main-page
  * /templates/page.contact.json - Changed from general-content to main-page
- All pages now use: {"sections":{"main":{"type":"main-page","settings":{"padding_top":28,"padding_bottom":28}}},"order":["main"]}
- This ensures pages display content entered in Shopify admin instead of hardcoded liquid content
