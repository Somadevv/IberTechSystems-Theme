# Product Tabs Implementation Plan

## Overview
Moving product tabs to display alongside the product image on the right side, improving styling to match the reference design, and fixing the "Write a Review" button functionality.

## Current Status
- ✅ Added product_tabs block type to main-product section
- ✅ Updated product.json template to use the block instead of separate section
- ❌ Tabs still appear below product instead of alongside
- ❌ Styling doesn't match reference design
- ❌ "Write a Review" button doesn't work

---

## Task 1: Move Product Tabs to Right Side of Product Image

**Current Issue:** Tabs appear below the product image instead of alongside it in the right column.

**Proposed Solution:** Modify the main-product section CSS and layout to display tabs in the product info column (right side) instead of full-width below.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Update product-tabs.css to integrate with existing product layout grid
2. Modify the product_tabs block positioning in main-product.liquid 
3. Ensure responsive behavior on mobile devices

## Task 2: Improve Tabs Styling to Match Reference Design

**Current Issue:** Current tabs styling is basic and doesn't match the clean, modern look from your reference image.

**Proposed Solution:** 
- Update tab buttons to have cleaner, more minimal styling
- Improve typography and spacing
- Add better hover and active states
- Match the visual hierarchy from reference image

**Specific Style Changes:**
1. Cleaner tab button design with subtle borders
2. Better typography (font size, weight, spacing)
3. Improved color scheme and contrast
4. More compact layout to fit in right column
5. Enhanced active/inactive state styling

## Task 3: Fix "Write a Review" Button Functionality

**Current Issue:** Button doesn't do anything when clicked.

**Current Implementation:** Button tries to scroll to `#product-review-form` but this element doesn't exist on the page.

**Proposed Solutions (choose one):**
A. **Modal Approach:** Open a review form in a modal/popup
B. **Scroll to Form:** Add the review form section to the page and make button scroll to it
C. **External Integration:** Link to a third-party review system (Judge.me, Yotpo, etc.)
D. **Simple mailto:** Open email client with pre-filled review request

**Recommended Approach:** Option B - Add review form to page and scroll to it

## Task 4: CSS Integration with Existing Theme

**Current Issue:** Product tabs CSS may conflict with existing theme styles.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Audit existing CSS classes and variables
2. Ensure tabs integrate seamlessly with current color scheme
3. Use existing theme typography and spacing variables
4. Make sure tabs work with both light and dark modes (if applicable)

## Task 5: Mobile Responsiveness

**Current Issue:** Need to ensure tabs work well on mobile devices.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Stack tabs vertically on mobile if needed
2. Ensure touch-friendly button sizes
3. Proper spacing and readability on small screens
