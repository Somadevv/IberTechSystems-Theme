# How to Add Custom Product Features

## Quick Setup Guide

Your product pages now support custom features that you can set up in Shopify Admin.

### Option 1: Use Metafields (Recommended)

1. Go to **Products** in Shopify Admin
2. Click on a product
3. Scroll to **Metafields** section
4. Add this metafield:
   - **Namespace:** `custom`
   - **Key:** `features` 
   - **Value:** `Feature 1|Feature 2|Feature 3|Feature 4|Feature 5`

**Example:**
```
High Torque Motor|Weather Resistant Build|Smart Control Compatibility|Obstacle Detection|Versatile Application
```

### Option 2: Remove ---FEATURES--- from Description

If you have product descriptions with `---FEATURES---` text, just remove that text. The system will automatically clean up the display.
